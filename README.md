# ResistanceAssist
This small console app designed to help players of The Resistance and especially its variant, The Resistance: Avalon.

In a normal game of The Resistance: Avalon, players have secret roles they must play. In the beginning, players close their eyes and reveal themselves to a select few players (a Merlin player, for example) as well. To remove the possibility of players seeing too much or giving away too much during this phase, ResistanceAssist is a standalone application that lets players pass around a single laptop or (or simply look at a desktop) to get their roles and any extra information secretly.

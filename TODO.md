#Functionality that needs to be added...

--All spies need to be informed of all other spies. if player_loyalty_dict[i] == 'SPY'...'ASSASSIN'...

--During the assignment screen when players get their roles, Merlin needs to see all players' roles, except the ASSASSIN, which will be displayed as 'SPY'--the same as the other evil minions.
